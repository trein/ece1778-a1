==========

Android app following the requirements of ECE1778 assignment 1.

Requirements
------------
Write a mobile application that presents the users with four fields: 

1. A text field that initially contains the word *"Things haven't started yet"*
2. A button labeled Change.
3. A button labeled Picture.
4. The standard menu.
 
The program should respond to the pressing of the buttons in the following way: 

- When Change is pressed, the text field should have its contents changed to *"The Change Button has been pressed 1 times."* Subsequent presses of the button should increment beyond the number 1.

- When the Picture button is pressed, a picture of a dog should appear below the buttons. The next time it is pressed, the picture should disappear, and then appear on alternate presses. 

- Also, make use of the default menu that is supplied in Android, and change the *"settings"*  button to become a *"reset"* button. When this button is selected, the text field should return to be *"Things haven't started yet"* and the count should be reset to 0.
